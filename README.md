# NextMan
A turn based pac man game using ReactJS, NextJS, TypeScript and Emotion (CSS-in-JS)

This is just an exercise project for me to get familiar with NextJS.

If you want to build it yourself you need to download the tileset images from this tutorial
https://www.construct.net/en/tutorials/cloning-classics-pacman-171
and copy them into the "static/images" folder of the project.

You also gonna need to install nodeJS.

Once you're all set perform the following steps:
1. Open you command line in the project directory
2. Enter "npm install"
3. Enter "npm run dev"
4. Open your webbrowser and enter this URL: "http://localhost:3000"
